# List of various bike tricks

## 360

The name really gives this one away; the rider does a full 360º rotation to one side while in the air

## Backflip

A backflip in slopestyle is like any other backflip, but with a bike. The rider throws bike and body backwards in a full rotation until facing the original direction again.

## Cash Roll

This trick, made famous on mountain bikes by Nicolai Rogatkin, is almost as hard to grasp as it is to explain, but basically it is doing a 180 to backflip to 180.

## Cork

A cork is an off-axis rotation. The rider and bike rotates a full 360º but instead of doing it straight backwards, forwards or to the side, they do it off-axis.

## Can-Can

A bit like the dance move, but done on a bike. A can-can is when the rider takes one foot off the pedal and kicks the leg over the top tube.

## Barspin

A barspin is pretty much what it sounds like – a spin of the bars. The rider throws the handlebars a full rotation (360º) before catching them again.
