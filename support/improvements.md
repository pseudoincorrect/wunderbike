# Things I would improve to make it to production

- Use a reverse proxy for the backend and front-end server
- Create end to end testing for the backend (complete scenario)
- Improve the validation on the requests
- Use a UI library for the front end (MUI for instance)
- Create different environment for development and prod, especially for Auth0 and Docker
- Use a secret manager for instance AWS Secret Manager
- Add authorization to the route with oauth scopes
- Prevent User to access other user's resources
- Use the ID token for user personalization
- Using gitlab for CI/CD
- Add the domains to CORS (frontend server and backend server)
- Add more capabilities to the frontend (edit tricks)
- Maybe use a ORM for the database
